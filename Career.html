	<h2>Career Mentoring Program</h2>
	<p> The Career Mentoring program is a career exploration and mentoring program for teens (age 14-18). We partner Club members with volunteers in various careers, so that the members can experience the professional workplace and explore the possibilities that await after graduating high school.</p>

<p>We currently have mentoring opportunities in retail management, advertising, engineering, social work, nursing, and criminal justice. And if any Club members express interest in a specific career, we will work hard to find a local mentor in that field.</p>
